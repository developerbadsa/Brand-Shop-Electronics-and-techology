## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in using their email and password. The registration and login pages include error handling for password criteria and email matching.

- **Home Page:** A well-structured home page featuring a navbar, banner, and footer. Users can navigate to different sections of the website, including adding products to the cart.

- **Product Listings:** Users can filter products by brand and product type. At least six brand names are showcased on the home page, each with a brand image and name. Additional sections are added to enhance user engagement.

- **Cart Management:** A dedicated cart page allows users to view and delete added products. Adding products to the cart triggers success messages through toasts/alerts.

- **User Profile:** After logging in, the user's name and profile picture appear on the navbar, and a logout button is provided for convenience.

- **Brand Pages:** Clicking on a brand redirects users to pages with brand-specific products, accompanied by an advertisement slider and product listings.

- **Error Handling:** A custom 404 (not found) page is included for handling invalid URLs. Validation errors are displayed for registration and login, either below input fields or via alerts/toasts.
